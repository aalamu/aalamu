#### Hi,

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building secure, scalable back-end systems and exploring ideas at the edge of engineering and creativity. I work mostly with **Java**, **Kotlin**, and **Python** — and love diving into **Spring Boot**, event-driven architectures, cloud-native patterns, and clean code practices. On the front end, I use **Angular** to bring ideas to life with interactivity and structure.

I care about developer experience and internationalization, which led me to create [Localizer](https://github.com/aalamu/localizer), a library to simplify i18n in Java apps. I also contribute to projects like [Hibernate Validator](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator) and experiment with generative AI in tools like [Detective Z](https://github.com/aalamu/detective-z).

## 🚀 Projects

- [Localizer](https://github.com/aalamu/localizer) — An open-source library that helps you localize your Java applications and APIs easily. Designed with deep Spring Boot integration and support for multiple locales.
  
- [Detective Z](https://github.com/aalamu/detective-z) — An AI-powered investigation assistant that guides users through complex decision trees in real time using reactive programming and generative AI.

**Interests**

- 🌍 In my free time, I try to catch up with what's going on around the globe.
- 🕵️‍♂️ I support other collaborators on [Detective Z](https://github.com/aalamu/detective-z)
- 🕵️‍♂️ I work with Angular and Spring in building the new era social network 
- 🤖 I teach people the basics of AI, Internet usage, Microsoft Office, and web development.

**🌱 Learning** 
- I do learn DevOps and Cyber Security
